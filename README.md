# Step by Step Math Solver 
### Math expression solver (solution with steps) 

Written in **python**, this step-wise math solver solves basic mathematical expressions by following BODMAS/PEMDAS rule. One unique feature of this solver is that it supports floating point numbers (decimal numbers) as well and produces accurate step by step solution with description for each steps as well.

## Prerequisites 
- Python 3.x

## Usage
Run the [main.py](https://github.com/shivamsingha/mathexpsolver1/blob/master/main.py) file and enter the expression when prompted for it.
